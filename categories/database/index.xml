      <description>Recently I found myself in a situation where I had to view all the tables in the Oracle Server.
I did some digging and came up with these helpful queries.

      <description>Whenever you are using Sql Membership and Profiler classes - Trying to generate reports make sure your query&amp;rsquo;s WHERE clause is using &amp;ldquo;indexed&amp;rdquo; column names at least.
Let&amp;rsquo;s look at some of the more used tables. The index of some of the tables is given below:

 NonClustered = UserID
  Table: aspnet_users
 Clustered Index = ApplicationID, LoweredUserName
 NonClustered Index = ApplicationID, LastActivityDate</description>
