      <title>Gitlab CLI API reference</title>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a short tutorial on setting up gitlab cli for yourselves. It is extremely user friendly and you can take almost any action that you need. Anything that the UI provides is also available over cli or web services - both of which have examples here.
Let&amp;rsquo;s get started.
gitlab cli Installing the gitlab CLI # http://narkoz.github.io/gitlab/configuration gem install gitlab  Configuration export GITLAB_API_ENDPOINT=&amp;#39;http://gitlab.com/api/v3&amp;#39; export GITLAB_API_PRIVATE_TOKEN=&amp;#39;YOUR_TOKEN_&amp;#39; Available commands $ gitlab +-----------------+ | Help Topics | +-----------------+ | Branches | +-----------------+ | Commits | +-----------------+ | Groups | +-----------------+ | Issues | +-----------------+ | Labels | +-----------------+ | MergeRequests | +-----------------+ | Milestones | +-----------------+ | Namespaces | +-----------------+ | Notes | +-----------------+ | Projects | +-----------------+ | Repositories | +-----------------+ | RepositoryFiles | +-----------------+ | Snippets | +-----------------+ | SystemHooks | +-----------------+ | Users | +-----------------+ Sample CLI commands # Check the list of Projects $ gitlab projects # Based on the response, we know reconwisev2 is ID 487928 # Let&amp;#39;s find out the list of labels in it $ gitlab labels 487928 +---------------------+---------+--------------------+--------------+-------------------+---------------------------+------------+ | Gitlab.</description>

      <title>Protobuf on Docker</title>
      <link>http://abhipandey.com/2016/06/protobuf-on-docker/</link>

      <description>Found it really strange that nobody had mentioned on their blog how to compile Protobuf in python with C++ implementation.
I had been having a lot of trouble with the compilation of python protobuf. After struggling with it for a few months on and off I decided to give Docker a try as I realized that my own Fedora OS may be the one having troubles. Thought of starting with Ubuntu Docker as I&amp;rsquo;ve had success with it earlier with such compilation scripts.</description>

      <title>Using TODO in Fedora</title>

      <description>I recently started using Fedora for work and had to manage a lot of tasks on various projects. The list was big enough and there&amp;rsquo;s no proper support for Evernote in linux, my trusty todo list manager or ToDo list manager by AbstractSpoon. Decided to try post-it notes but my list was changing on an ad-hoc basis. Finally came across an extension Todo.txt.
Turned out this was just what I was looking for.</description>

      <description>When you are working on Agile Boards in JIRA, you may want to retrieve all the issues related to a particular board or the sprint. Usually you&amp;rsquo;d find issues in progress under the dashboard of the sprint itself.
Python JIRA allows you only a few options:
 incompleted issues completed issues removed issues  As you will also notice from jira docs the sprints function in there only provides you sprints.</description>

      <description>After installing spf13 vim every time I would open a file I had trouble with two things on my mac:
 File opening would halt in the middle with the following error : Cannot find word list &amp;ldquo;en.utf-8.spl&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;en.ascii.spl&amp;rdquo; Syntax highlighting also failed thereafter  Here&amp;rsquo;s what I would see:
$ vim release.sh Warning: Cannot find word list &amp;#34;en.utf-8.spl&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;en.ascii.spl&amp;#34; Press ENTER or type command to continue I googled a lot regarding this but didn&amp;rsquo;t find anything straight forward.</description>

      <description>I recently wanted to setup a wiki so that I could convert it into a static html site with a proper themes. What could be a possible use case for such a requirement:
 Manage the documentation of a product internally through git but publish it for clients/world through static site Convert the uncolored wiki to a themed version Allow serving of the wiki through web application frameworks like Django  It may allow you to have authentication system as a first step hurdle to stop everybody from giving access   Anyways, I went about the whole process and decided to jot down everything.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had this need quite a few times to pull out a section of logs that would begin with a particular line and end with another. grep is not exactly useful there because it only prints out sections based on line counters (using -A/B/C) lines based on a single search pattern.
I came up with a script that can run at almost same speeds using grep/cat/awk. awk is used to decide whether the end of the section has been reached or not.</description>

      <title>Tokenize a String using C&#43;&#43;</title>

      <guid>http://abhipandey.com/2014/04/tokenize-a-string-using-c-/</guid>
      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a short snippet to split a string into multiple tokens; into a vector. As you will see that, if you run the code, boost version performs better because you can choose a number of delimiters to split your string instead of the vanilla version using the normal C++ code. Of course, you may also write your own code to do something like this but I was looking to do some short snippets.</description>

      <title>CVS Cheat Sheet</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on CVS for a long time now and figured out that I&amp;rsquo;d save a lot of time if I started writing alias or functions for the numerous tasks that I did on them. I will put down some of them here so you may benefit from them.
Silently update and inform about the status of the files (recursive)
cvs -q -n update  Same as earlier but will only do so for the current folder</description>

      <title>Cursor Control in VIM Search</title>

      <description>Found a great way to search for keywords &amp;amp;&amp;amp; control the location of cursor in vim. It is excellent if you want to do a particular task multiple times. Usually if you search the cursor will straight away take you to the start of search. What if you want to go to the end of the word you are searching for?
/pattern/e  This takes you to the END of the keyword you are looking for.</description>

      <title>Change Putty Window Title</title>

      <description>How to modify the Putty window title to a specific string?
By default, you&amp;rsquo;d like to have the window title to give you the full path to the folder you are working from (working directory). PROMPT_COMMANDwill help you with that.
However, if you have too many windows where you are on the same folder then it may become confusing. To set your own title you&amp;rsquo;d like to use the title() function provided here.</description>

      <title>Google Analytics &amp; SWFAddress</title>

      <description>Recently found a bug slash issue with Google Analytics new javscript software (post-urchin v5). I had written the internal documentation for the company standards and somehow when those standards were put into practice, SWFAddress feature of flash stopped working the moment google analytics feature was enabled. Worst of all, the web pages failed to load! To cap it off, the website was working perfectly fine on Firefox 2, 3 and IE 7!</description>

      <title>Full Trust on Mapped Drive</title>

      <description>Sometimes, when opening a web project from another mapped drive (not your own computer&amp;rsquo;s hard disk) Visual Studio may complain something like this:
The project location is not trusted. Running the application may result in security exceptions when it attempts to perform actions which require full trust.  The problem here is that .Net does not want to fully adhere to all security policies as your hard disk to this mapped drive as well as it does not know what kind of data it might have.</description>

      <title>Talk to my... Flash?</title>

      <guid>http://abhipandey.com/2008/03/talk-to-my...-flash/</guid>
      <description>According to normal acceptable behaviour it is not possible to let flash talk to the computer, be it on desktop or web browser.
There are always ways around a problem and there&amp;rsquo;s one in this case as well.
Windows Forms
If you wanted to access .net functions on windows form then probably a good way to do that would be through ShockWaveFlashObjects library. It wraps all the functions that are available in ShockWave Objects and makes them available to you in .</description>
