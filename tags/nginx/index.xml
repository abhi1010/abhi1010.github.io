      <description>If I am not wrong, nginx only allows you to upload up till max 2Mb of data by default. If you are doing a docker deployment on beanstalk you may to remember to change that not once but twice!
As you may know already, beanstalk creates an EC2 instance to manage the docker environment.
Since EC2 needs to manage the docker environment and serve the web interface as well, it does so by having another nginx instance to serve the nginx within docker.</description>

 /var/log so that you can keep track of logs nginx specific folders because you will have two instances of nginx running - one on docker and another on EC2. This allows you to share logs  Also read this post for related info  your personal workspace or anything that you&amp;rsquo;d like to share  Here&amp;rsquo;s how you&amp;rsquo;d do it.</description>
