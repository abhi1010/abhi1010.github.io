      <description>I recently wanted to setup a wiki so that I could convert it into a static html site with a proper themes. What could be a possible use case for such a requirement:
 Manage the documentation of a product internally through git but publish it for clients/world through static site Convert the uncolored wiki to a themed version Allow serving of the wiki through web application frameworks like Django  It may allow you to have authentication system as a first step hurdle to stop everybody from giving access   Anyways, I went about the whole process and decided to jot down everything.</description>
