      <description>Found it really strange that nobody had mentioned on their blog how to compile Protobuf in python with C++ implementation.
I had been having a lot of trouble with the compilation of python protobuf. After struggling with it for a few months on and off I decided to give Docker a try as I realized that my own Fedora OS may be the one having troubles. Thought of starting with Ubuntu Docker as I&amp;rsquo;ve had success with it earlier with such compilation scripts.</description>
