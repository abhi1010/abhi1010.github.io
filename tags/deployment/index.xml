      <description>Experience with Gitlab CI   Git Mirror from Gitlab to Bitbucket using Gitlab CI
  Had to move from BitBucket to Gitlab; which is really great, btw. However, there was one tiny issue here - Gitlab was not supported by Shippable. As you may know already Shippable is a hosted cloud platform that provides hosted continuous integration. We use it in our current setup to do a full testing and deployment onto AWS Elastic Beanstalk.</description>

      <description>It may seem like a daunting task to have multiple python projects running in their own virtual environments in docker as you want to manage the running of the tasks from a single source - let&amp;rsquo;s say supervisord. However, all that is required here is to know that python automatically picks up the location of the virtual environments if you provide full path to the virtual environment&amp;rsquo;s python.
For example, in my docker environment, I have virtual environment install at the following location:</description>
