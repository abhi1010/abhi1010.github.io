      <description>Powerline
  I was having a lot of trouble getting powerline to work on my mac machine. No matter what I tried, I was getting errors like the following:
.oh-my-zsh/themes/powerline.zsh-theme:100: character not in range Finally got it to work after multiple attempts on bash and zsh.
All I had to do was set LC_ALL to en_US.UTF-8. It would set all the locales to en_US.UTF-8 which would allow powerline fonts work properly.</description>
