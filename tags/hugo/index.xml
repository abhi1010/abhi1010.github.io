      <description>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://abhipandey.com/images/moving_to_hugo__demo.png&#34;&#xA;    alt=&#34;Create your own blog&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;      &lt;p&gt;Create your own blog&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My blogging experience started with &lt;code&gt;blogspot&lt;/code&gt;. It was great until I realized that I needed something that was responsive.&#xA;The layout looked nice on 1024x768 but with the new generation of screens it started to look narrow.&#xA;I hated the look of the website when it seemed that I was wasting a lot of white space on the web pages.&#xA;I moved to &lt;code&gt;wordpress.com&lt;/code&gt; to give that a try when they started their responsive themes.&#xA;The website looked great after a lot of customization but after writing some posts there,&#xA;I realized that I had to &lt;strong&gt;micro-manage&lt;/strong&gt; a lot of styling every time I was writing some new section, like special blocks or tables.&#xA;The post writing was fun only for a short while. The enthusiasm died down pretty soon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
