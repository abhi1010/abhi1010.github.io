      <title>Reading Excel in C#</title>

      <description>Recently had to work on an Excel and update its content when some events were triggered on a Bloomberg terminal. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any code for reading the excel file using C# so thought of putting that up.
There were a few things to learn:
 Excel support is not available by default so make sure to add Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel as a reference
 Sometime indexing to reference the Workbooks or Worksheets may not work so try out other values</description>

      <description>I have been doing extensive research today regarding shared memory in linux before I embark on a new project in which shaving time off process communication latency is extremely important. I found some very interesting links as well. Let’s break them down:

      <title>Visual Studio 2008 crashes while adding items</title>

      <description>Had this problem cropping up since months where I was trying to add items to Visual Studio 2008 Toolbox and it kept crashing.
Finally got a work around, you should start it in safe mode. Here&amp;rsquo;s the procedure:
devenv /safemode  Then use Choose Items on toolbox and run through each of the tabs. Once you accept any exceptions raised on loading controls, you can then open Visual Studio normally and add items.</description>

      <title>Tag your namespaces</title>
      <link>http://abhipandey.com/2008/03/tag-your-namespaces/</link>

      <guid>http://abhipandey.com/2008/03/tag-your-namespaces/</guid>
      <description>Recently discovered a nifty little feature on .Net and though of sharing it.
You can tag an assembly by giving it a name and then use this name throughout your class to access the classes inside this namespace.
&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color:#0000ff;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;using&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; asp=CompanyName.Data;  Now all the classes inside CompanyName.Data namespace can be accessed using the name asp (as if it was an instance of the namespace).
One thing to note, however, is that the classes inside this namespace cannot be accessed directly and the word &amp;ldquo;asp&amp;rdquo; has to be used.</description>

      <title>Creating Custom Web Controls</title>

      <description>How do you extend a control? Let&amp;rsquo;s figure it out.
Why would you want to extend existing controls?
Because some functionality may not exist exactly as you may need it. For example, let&amp;rsquo;s take up ImageButton control example. It is a great control but it falls short when it comes to real world scenario. Mostly websites do a hover image clickable button where the text or background color of the button changes once you hover your mouse over it.</description>

      <title>StringBuilder vs String joins</title>
      <link>http://abhipandey.com/2008/03/stringbuilder-vs-string-joins/</link>

      <description>For those who do not want to waste their time, here&amp;rsquo;s the gist for this whole article: StringBuilder performs better but you should try to use it when there&amp;rsquo;s lot of concatenation involved (normally more than 7 joins - start thinking about StringBuilder.
Let&amp;rsquo;s move on for the lesser mortals. There has been a lot of debate about using StringBuilder instead of adding string like
&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color:#606060;&amp;quot;&amp;gt; 1:&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; strVariable += &amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color:#006080;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;quot; Add this string to my variable string&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;;  What&amp;rsquo;s the darn difference?</description>

      <description>Two blogs i really like and follow many a times are:
SqlAuthority.com - Excellent blog for Sql Server 2005. The guy has a very in-depth knowledge of Sql Server and I appreciate the way
Scott&amp;rsquo;s Blog - Another great blog where Scott Guthrie talks quite a bit about ASP.NET and tells the latest details coming in from Microsoft.
Just today I found another interesting blog. This guy talks about the interesting aspects in programming.</description>

      <title>Dynamically increase Label size [AutoSize]</title>
      <link>http://abhipandey.com/2007/11/dynamically-increase-label-size-autosize/</link>

      <guid>http://abhipandey.com/2007/11/dynamically-increase-label-size-autosize/</guid>
      <description>Recently I had to work on a windows form where the Labels are added dynamically onto the form. Some of you may think that setting AutoSize to true would fix the problem but it works only when you already have added that Label control onto the form, not when you are adding it dynamically.
Despair not, there&amp;rsquo;s still a solution. Just create a label and set it&amp;rsquo;s text first then call this function:</description>

      <title>Use of yield statement</title>
      <link>http://abhipandey.com/2007/10/use-of-yield-statement/</link>

      <guid>http://abhipandey.com/2007/10/use-of-yield-statement/</guid>
      <description>It might be a little late for this to appear but I have no qualms in accepting that I have finally embraced yield statement and see it as an excellent way of writing codes.
I have had my fair share of writing small code fragments to read/process/write files and more often than that it is excel files. So I thought, there has to be an easier way than just creating common functions for Connections and processing functions - at that time yield statement came to the rescue.</description>
