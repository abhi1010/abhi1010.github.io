      <description>How do you partition a list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x?
Well, there are some solutions possible. The solution, I came up with, is a bit convoluted but let me tell the idea behind it. You want to track the following:
 Two pointers to remember the beginning of the lower and higher series each</description>

      <description>It is possible to a recursive solutions but I will use a simple runner logic. Recursive solutions are usually less optimal.
Note here that, in our logic K=1 would return the last element in the linked list. Similarly, K=2 would return the second last element.
The suggested solution here is to use two pointers:
 One pointer will first travel K items into the list Once that is done, both the pointers start travelling together, one item at a time They keep travelling until the end of linked list is found In that situation, the first pointer is at the end of the list, but the second pointer would have only reached till Kth element - this is what you want  Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at the code:</description>

      <title>Removing Duplicates from Linked List</title>

      <description>Duplicates can be removed in many ways:
 Create a new Linked List containing only unique items
 Iterate through the Linked List and keep removing items that are being repeated
  The internal structure itself for the algo can either be map or set based. When using map the Node itself can be saved thereby making your life easier if you are creating a new Linked List. However sets can be very useful if we are just iterating through the Linked List and simply deleting items that are being repetetive.</description>

      <description>Deleting a Node from Singly Linked List is rather straight forward.
 You have to know the head first of all
 Start by checking the head if that&amp;rsquo;s the one you are looking for
 Keep moving forward and checking - always check for null pointers everywhere
  Before we talk about the code, let&amp;rsquo;s see how Linked List is setup.  Now, below is the code for it&amp;hellip;.</description>
